              Before transitioning into technology, I was partner in a landscape
              construction company. In just 5 years we transformed a handyman
              repair sole-proprietorship into an incorporated contracting
              company specializing in custom landscaping design with net yearly
              revenue of $100,000 in our last three years of operation.
