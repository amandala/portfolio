The curriculum was iterative and new\n                technologies were often replacing older ones requiring me to\n                quickly become up to speed in order to best assist the students.\n                Calgary is a sattelite office from the Toronto based operations\n                so there was ample opportunity for me to help coordinate and\n                facilitate events such as demo days, showcase events, and\n                employer meet-and-greet sessions.\n              </p>\n            }\n          />\n          <Entry\n            title=\"Web Developer - LAMP Stack\"\n            location=\"RCKTSHP\"\n            date=\"2015 - 2016\"\n            details={\n              <p>\n                I was brought on as a contractor to help a local student\n                crowdfunding startup pivot to a freelancer marketplace that\n                aimed to connect local startups and small businesses with\n                student freelancers. I made extensive customizations to the\n                automation and workflow features of an existing marketplace\n                framework build on Wordpress for the year long project. Although\n                the endeavor was unsuccesful, the opportunity to dive into the\n                startup world birthed my love for the unknown. I also\n                successfully landed RCKTSHP a finalist position in Startup\n                Calgary's Launchpad Accelerator challenge on just two days\n                notice!\n              </p>\n            }\n          />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HomePage;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
